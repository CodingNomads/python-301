# Update the __add__() method so that instead of
# instantiating the new Ingredient() object with an amount of 1,
# it'll take whichever amount of the passed ingredients is smaller
#
# Example:
# c = Ingredient("carrot", 5)
# p = Ingredient("pea", 4)
# s = c + p
# print(s)
# >>> OUTPUT: carrotpea (4)
